# ABRaOM - Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations

The Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations is a variant repository containing genomic variants of Brazilians, with the goal to provide the community with genetic variability found in Brazil. The initial deposited cohort comprise exomic variants of 609 elderly individuals from a census-based sample from the city of São Paulo. A total of 2,382,573 variants were called before filtering and are available at our browser. From that total, 1,264,224 are high confidence (GATK PASS flags and excluding CEGH-USP FDP/FAB flags), which we retain for use in Open-CRAVAT.
